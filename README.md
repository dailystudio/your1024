# 1024 Game

This project implements a 1024 number game using Vue 3.

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to combine the provided numbers to reach the target value of 1024 using mathematical expressions.

1.  The game presents a set of numbers (currently 2, 4, 8, and 64).
2.  Players enter a mathematical expression into an input field.
3.  The game validates the expression, checking for valid characters (numbers, operators, parentheses, and whitespace) and verifying that all used numbers are part of the provided set.
4.  If the expression is valid and evaluates to 1024, the player wins.

## Technologies Used
